# Character Showcase Page

This project is a simple one-page website designed to showcase a series of characters. It features a hero section, a "top activities" section with three characters, and a final section with a concluding image. The design uses a combination of flexbox and basic styling to create a clean, responsive layout.

## Features

- **Hero Section:** A prominent top section with a background image and two headings.
- **Top Activities Section:** Displays three circular images of characters, each with a heading and a short description.
- **Final Section:** A concluding section with a final image and a heading.
- **Responsive Layout:** The page uses flexbox to ensure content is well-aligned and adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Structures the content of the page.
- **CSS3:** Styles the layout, fonts, colors, and images, including the use of flexbox for alignment and circular images.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the page's content.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that controls the styling and layout.
- `images/`: A directory for all the image files used on the page.

## Customization

To personalize this page, you can:

- **Update the text:** Change the headings and paragraphs in `index.html` to describe your own characters or topics.
- **Replace the images:** Swap the image files in the `images/` folder with your own photos.
- **Change the colors and fonts:** Modify the CSS in `styles.css` to match your preferred aesthetic.

# Space Exploration Landing Page

This project is a simple, single-page website for a fictional space exploration company. It's a visually appealing landing page designed to attract potential explorers. The design features a cosmic theme with a dynamic background, a company logo, and a call-to-action button.

## Features

- **Catchy Headline:** A bold headline with a unique underline effect grabs the user's attention.
- **Call-to-Action:** A clear "Apply" button encourages user engagement.
- **Custom Font:** The project uses the **Orbitron** font from Google Fonts to reinforce the futuristic theme.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Provides the structure for the landing page content.
- **CSS3:** Handles all styling, including the background image, font styling, button design, and layout.

# Personal Website

This is a simple, personal website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as an introduction, sharing a few fun facts and providing a link to my professional LinkedIn profile.

## Features

- **Personal Introduction:** A brief "Hola, my name is Shrikar" greeting.
- **Fun Facts:** A list of three fun facts about me.
- **Social Link:** A direct link to my LinkedIn profile.
- **Newsletter Signup:** A basic form with an email input field and a "For Newsletter" button.
- **Dynamic Styling:** The website's appearance can be customized by changing a few variables in the JavaScript file.

## Customization

You can easily customize the website's look and feel by editing the `index.js` file. The following functions control the different styling options:

- `favouriteMovieGenre()`: Changes the font style. Options include "superhero", "space", "scary", "military", "romantic", "cowboy", and "fantasy".
- `favouriteFruit()`: Changes the color theme. Options include "watermelon", "tomato", "banana", "orange", "avocado", and "blueberry".
- `favouriteMode()`: Toggles between a light and dark theme. Options are "light" and "dark".
- `favouriteEdgeStyle()`: Changes the border-radius of elements like the image and buttons. Options are "sharp", "soft", and "round".

To change a setting, simply modify the argument passed to the function in the `index.js` file. For example, to change the movie genre to a cowboy theme, you would change `favouriteMovieGenre("superhero")` to `favouriteMovieGenre("cowboy")`.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the structure of the website.
- **CSS3:** For styling and layout.

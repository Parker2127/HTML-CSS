# Google.com Homepage Clone

This project is a simple clone of the classic Google.com homepage, built with HTML and CSS. The goal was to replicate the core layout and styling of the search page, including the logo, search bar, and buttons.

## Features

- **Google Logo:** The iconic Google logo centered at the top.
- **Search Input:** A stylized search bar with rounded corners.
- **Action Buttons:** Two buttons for "Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky," centered below the search bar.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is designed to be a fixed size, replicating the desktop experience of the Google homepage.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Provides the semantic structure of the page.
- **CSS3:** Used for all styling, including centering elements, sizing, spacing, and button styles.

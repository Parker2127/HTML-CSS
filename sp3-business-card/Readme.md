# Digital Business Card

This project is a simple, digital business card created using HTML and CSS. It's a clean and modern representation of a personal business card, perfect for sharing contact information and a professional headshot.

## Features

- **Personal Information:** Displays a name, job title, and location.
- **Profile Picture:** A dedicated space for a professional headshot or avatar.
- **Clean Design:** A minimalist layout with a clear and easy-to-read font.
- **Customizable Styling:** The card's color palette, borders, and fonts can be easily changed within the CSS file.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Structures the content of the business card.
- **CSS3:** Styles the card, including the layout, colors, fonts, and borders.

## Customization

- **Colors:** The background and text colors are defined in the `.card` class in `styles.css`. You can change these to match your personal brand.
- **Fonts:** The font is set in the `body` selector. You can choose any web-safe font or import a custom one.
- **Layout:** The layout is handled with CSS Flexbox, making it easy to adjust the alignment and spacing of the elements.

1.  Replace the `src` attribute in the `<img>` tag in `index.html` with the path to your own profile picture.

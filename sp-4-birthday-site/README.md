# Birthday Gift Site

This is a fun and interactive birthday greeting website built with HTML and CSS. Instead of a static card, this site uses animated GIFs to express different birthday wishes, which are revealed when the user hovers over a gift box.

## Features

- **Personalized Header:** A header with the birthday person's name, age, and a profile picture.
- **Interactive Gifts:** Multiple gift sections, each with a hidden GIF that appears on hover.
- **Themed Design:** A celebratory color scheme and font (`Happy Monkey`) create a festive mood.
- **Simple & Responsive:** The layout is straightforward and works well on various screen sizes.
- **Call-to-Action Footer:** A footer encouraging users to create their own site, linking to a relevant course.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Provides the structure for the birthday card content.
- **CSS3:** Handles all the styling, including the background gradient, font imports, image styling, and the key `:hover` pseudo-class for the interactive gifts.

## How to Use

1.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the file in your web browser.
2.  **Hover over the gifts:** Move your mouse over each gift box to reveal a new GIF.

## Customization

To make this site your own:

1.  **Change the content:** Update the name, age, and date in the `index.html` file.
2.  **Replace the images:** Swap out the `bff-img` and the GIF files (`happy.gif`, `hot.gif`, etc.) in the `images` folder with your own.
3.  **Update the colors and fonts:** Modify the CSS in `styles.css` to match your preferred color palette and typography.
